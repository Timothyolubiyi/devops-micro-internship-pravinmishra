# Assignment 1 — Deploy a Static Website on a Cloud VM Using Docker

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will provision a cloud VM (AWS or Azure), automate Docker installation using Cloud-Init, containerize a static website with Docker and Nginx, and deploy it so it's accessible through the VM's public IP.
